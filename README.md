# Obs_Avoiding_robo
This project is an obstacle-avoiding robot built using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. It detects nearby obstacles in real-time and automatically changes direction to avoid collisions. The robot is ideal for demonstrating basic autonomous navigation and embedded system programming.
